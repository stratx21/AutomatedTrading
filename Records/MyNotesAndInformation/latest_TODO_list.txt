
to add to automation software: 
- fix dates in generated xslx
- add top 5 or 10 page to generated xslx
- add volume to streamed saved data 
- add minute based charts 
- add opts to backtest results db and reportBacktest xlsx
- try a variation of TSFH where x decreases as it goes up *(is this just simulating an OCO/PT bracket? - just add OCO/PT strategy)
- add heiken ashi study
- renko buy, sell on SMA ? find sells on buy conditions 
- test GUSH with different time constraints
- add study RSI 
- add strategy RSI 
- update backtesting system:
  - add db of backtesting results 
  - add get history functionality to backtesting - get history up to first timestamp
- generate xslx with charts etc for backtesting 
- allow multiple strategies for one stock 
- add strategy range smi + range wcsmi
- add strategy renko bah vs
- add strategy MACD
- add range and renko sma cross
  - permutations will add a lot of testing data 
  - add buy on cross, sell on cross below fast MA?
~~ think through: if it has a decent profit, then sell ? 
- try smi strategy with different %d %k ? 
- add sell command 
- add range strategy with simple price target system, after buying on green ? 
  - could buy with SMAG
- add higher low SMI ? (for range and renko ?)
- ! add quantity to strategy parameters
- add volume to streaming ? 
- add writeline and replacelastline to ui logging window options 
- add optional args to ui terminal title 
- rename stream files to compact name on exit 
  - or just don't use the whole date to name it 
- add account config to separate account from general config 

- create a whole UI system for backtesting
  - uses the output files
  - can choose the output files to analyze
  - can show a chart of profits


-NOTE: if you move strategies to be in processes in backtesting, the simulating config true may not be set in the process instances as well... might be if you set it before. 

- manage exception with ui pipe crashing entire program
- add command to check how long it has been running (save time at start)
- add params for each strategy to strats command 
- add time to candles when they print to log window
- on testing saved data, add not weekend to buy condition 
- add quantity argument to strategy addition 
- set up to retry connection 5 times if it fails to connect or disconnects 
- make script to show general and per stock data for orders data from TDA 
  - or dont buy if signal bar and current bar (bar after) are both phantoms 
- average the BA average with Last ? 
- fix there being two recv 's when updating token ? 
- check if old refresh tokens can be used 
- add icon ? just for fun 




=================================
before running server 24/7:
- add is weekday to isWithinBuyTimeConstraint 
- make new autosell timer per day 
- make it so adding or removing a strategy will add/remove it real time 
  ~ essentially be able to add/remove strategies without affecting the streaming, as long as the tickers are included in what is being streamed. 
  - will take a custom command in pipe
  - if not started, dont worry 
  - difficulty is adding a ticker to the stream 
  -**: could keep a list of tickers currently being streamed, dont need to restart TDA services if it is already being streamed. 
  - add a remove all strategies command 
- add not weekend to buy condition 
- allow adding tickers to stream after start 
  # warning: the more streaming, the more unneccessary data needs to be ignored by the data mediator for routing to the strategies 
- connect to a discord bot 
  - regular ping message
  - sends messages for orders 
  - sends messages for PL (- real PL ? and %)
    - total and per stock 
  - accepts commands 
  - warning for refresh token expiring soon 
- make it so the program can run non-stop
  - add close connection option to pipe for TDA 
  - be able to continue saving stream without trading
  - only add tickers to streaming if they are not already being streamed
  - add TDA function to add tickers to stream ? 
- make website to display data 


===================================
cleaning code:
- organize user commands and main control into a main manager
  - each command goes into a function 
  - make one function to take in string input for commands, and relay to other command functions 
  - create map for each run type (trade, vs save stream), mapping string to function for each possible command 
- remove the isJH2 stuff everywhere if the same token can be used twice 
- change renko_bah to green count > red count - more reliable 
- update config.marketIsOpen to be updated by a timer or something rather than checking current time every time (difficult because of different processes)



===============================
Future Imrovements:
- record params + info on Renko vbs and sa and bah
- add sell command 
- add config edits:
  - time constraint
  - save strategies as a config to load them (try inputting file as stdin first?)
- create UI for all the user inputs, adding tickers to stream, adding strategies, etc ?
- add command to start process to start a backtesting ? 


- add command "chart" to show chart for specified ticker 
  - would this use the updating csv data? or from held data? 
    - will this need a lower level mediator to distribute the data?
    - the csv data now is the stream, NOT the candle data... therefore using the csv would be a whole separate program to pull data and make the chart. but make sure there are no read/write conflicts... and how would it trigger from new data? 
     - best to be in a subprocess it seems 
  - will need to manage time for each candle 

- add command to use config file to add strategies
- add UI to see chart 
- add script to summarize record data 
- design software for market maker ? - needs order manager 

- change strategy stock data to a parent stock data, set up a range strategy to inherit from instead of Strategy for range strategies 
  - after previous ^ : remove printing history candles, instead print the last candle in enablePostHistory to show last candle after history finished. 

- add a disable printing candle data (much later)
  - a quiet function : disable candle after history too ? 
- add a logger - logs to file as well as prints to screen 





once I have the 25k:
- can add shorting
  - short after 1 green, buy back after next bar (find charts with lots of 1s)
