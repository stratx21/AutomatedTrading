<html id="scratchpad">14:15 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: I wanted to check in and look into this before doing it:<br>market makers will offer the bid and ask, and sometimes the spread gets a bit large<br>so I figure, could I just add limit orders with a small quantity (1-10 shares), a limit sell right below the Ask, and a limit buy right above the bid, and profit off the difference, but I looked it up, and what I was finding was market makers need to be registered with the SEC and a whole bunch of stuff<br>would doing this make me a market maker, am I not allowed to do this?<br>wanted to check if I'm allowed to before doing it<br>14:15 <font color='#00c800'>admin</font>: Thank you for chatting with us. We appreciate your patience as the next available associate will be with you as soon as possible. Did you know you can find answers to many commonly asked questions by visiting the 'Help &amp; Learning' section on the mobile app or under 'Learning Center' on the Education tab of thinkorswim desktop?<br>14:32 <b>Jake_E</b>: Hi, my name is Jake! That's a great question I'd be happy to discuss trading rules that would apply to you in this case.<br>14:35 <b>Jake_E</b>: First you'd need to look at how TOS will handle these orders. You can have an order to buy or an order to sell working, but not both at the same time. If you place an order to buy, the sell order would have to be linked to be activated after the buy fills.<br>14:38 <b>Jake_E</b>: So let's say a stock has a bid of 10.20 and an ask of 10.30, so you set a buy at 10.21, and then a sell order to activate at 10.29 when after your buy fills. Then your buy fills at 10.21, now you have a sell working at 10.29. There is nothing to guarantee that any buyers are going to want to pay 10.29/share, or anywhere above the 10.21 you paid. The next bidder was at 10.20 and that might be the highest bid that anyone places that day except for yours.<br>14:41 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: okay sweet, but they are filled by market orders right?<br>14:42 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: as long as I'm having a buy then a sell it's not a problem? and I'm assuming not having a buy and a sell at the same time is a general TDA rule right? not just on TOS?<br>14:44 <b>Jake_E</b>: Your limit orders could be filled by market orders or by limit orders. The biggest issue you can run into is that we don't know if anyone will submit a buy market order when you are selling at 10.29. Additionally, if there are other sellers at 10.29 there orders could be filled by a buy market order instead of yours.<br>14:44 <b>Jake_E</b>: Having a buy and then a sell is not a problem.<br>14:45 <b>Jake_E</b>: And yes, not having a buy and a sell is a general TDA rule and a rule at most brokers as far as I'm aware.<br>14:46 <b>Jake_E</b>: You may also run into Rule 390. If you average more than 390 orders a day over a 1 month period we have to designate your account a professional account and charge a commission of $2.00/trade.<br>14:48 <b>Jake_E</b>: I also want to mention FINRA's Pattern Daytrade Rule. if you're employing the strategy mentioned above you will incure daytrades pretty quickly. Are you familiar with that PDT rule?<br>14:51 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: ohh dang, thanks for all the information! Yeah, I've looked into PDT a lot. I'm hoping to have 25k for scaling up later :)))<br>14:52 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: if I started a personal business would it have to have a different account, like that professional account?<br>14:56 <b>Jake_E</b>: If you want to open an LLC for trading then you would want to open an LLC account for it. Note that in an LLC or any other professional account you have to pay a monthly subscription fee to get live quotes, it comes out to about $140/month.<br>14:57 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: oh wow that's a good bit. would there be any other fees, or commissions?<br>14:58 <b>Jake_E</b>: No that would be the only other fee change although maintaining an LLC may carry some fees in your state so you'd want to check into that as well and look into what the tax consequences of trading in an LLC account vs a personal account would be.<br>14:59 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: okay sweet sounds good!<br>15:00 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: so is the 390 rule per account? if I have a linked account, can I make less than 390 orders on each per day?<br>15:00 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: and I'm assuming replacing an order counts as an order, right?<br>15:04 <b>Jake_E</b>: It is based on your client profile with us, so splitting it across accounts will not allow you to go over 390. And yes, replaced orders would count towards that total.<br>15:05 <b>Jake_E</b>: I'll also not that you'd need to avoid order spoofing, which is where you place orders that you have no intention of letting fill and then cancel them.<br>15:07 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: ah okay thanks, this is super good to know<br>15:08 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: one more question that I know of right now, I tried to stream data from two computers using two different accounts and two different API keys, etc, but it seems whenever one runs the other gets disconnected, is the streaming allowing only one connection per client profile? or is that the network?<br>15:10 <b>Jake_E</b>: Great question. You'd need to at least be on a separate device, network, and account.<br>15:10 <b>Jake_E</b>: So if you had another TOS account on another computer running on a different internet connection you could do that.<br>15:12 <b>Jake_E</b>: You can also just use the same account login if you use a different platform. For example I have an iPad that I use to keep TOS mobile up to monitor my second, long-term investments account.<br>15:13 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: okay solid, thanks! that's about all the questions I have at the moment, thank you again for your help! you're very thorough<br></html>
