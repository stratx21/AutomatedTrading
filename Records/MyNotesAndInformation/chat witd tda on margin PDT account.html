<html id="scratchpad">09:49 <font color='#00c800'>josh_21</font>: If I have a margin account at $25,000+,<br>and I make many day trades, but NOT at the same time (current positions never exceeds my account cash balance),<br>how much value of traddes can I make in one day?<br>there is 0 day settlement, right? so could I make infinite day trades in one day? or would that still use margin to have a total power used in one day higher than my cash in the account? (again, never exceeding my current cash amount in current positions, all at different times)<br>09:49 <font color='#00c800'>admin</font>: Thank you for chatting with us.
